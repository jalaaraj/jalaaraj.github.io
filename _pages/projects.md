## **SIDE PROJECT: LLM-Powered Network Privacy Auditor**

**Description:**  
A proof-of-concept for a tool that translates raw network traffic logs (e.g., DNS queries, connection logs) into human-readable privacy reports. The system uses an LLM, backed by a knowledge base of known tracking domains and network protocols, to identify and explain potential data leaks or surveillance activities in a network's device communication.

**Technologies Used:** 
- Python, LlamaIndex, LangChain, LangGraph

**Project Status:**  
- Conceptual / In Progress

## **Bystander Privacy**

**Description:**  
Working on a system to allow for bystander privacy.

**Technologies Used:**  
- Kotlin, Android Development, OpenGL, Python

**Project Status:**  
- In Progress, a short paper accepted at ACM MobiHoc'25

## **VBIT: Visualizing and Blocking of IoT Trackers**

**Description:**  
An interactive system that combines Mixed Reality (MR) and web-based applications to help users identify and manage data collection by Internet of Things (IoT) devices in shared spaces. By analyzing network traffic, VBIT enables users to visualize tracking services and take action to stop or limit unwanted data collection, offering transparency and control over IoT privacy.

**Technologies Used:**  
- Python (Flask)
- JavaScript/CSS
- SQLite (for storing user data and challenges)

**Project Status:**  
- Under Review at ACM TIOT Journal
